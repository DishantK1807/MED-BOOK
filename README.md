INTRODUCTION

The function of compiling, editing and processing patient’s data makes the work complicated and tedious process. DOCBOOK is an effort in the direction to use computers for the purpose of saving patient’s information like: name, age, blood group, allergies, last date of visit, etc.  It is both user friendly as well as time saving.
This is a foundation level. Emphasis has been given in this application to replicate all the process required about the patients. DOCBOOK is itself sufficient with all the information required about the patients. Once the information is fed to the system it can identify individual patients. 

The program code has been written in ‘C++’ language. ‘C++’ has been chosen because of its procedural nature and the flexibility it provides in interacting with hardware and operating system efficiently.
